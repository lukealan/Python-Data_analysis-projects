### Project Overview

This project involves three key stages:

1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Corrected negative values in guest numbers, removed outliers in revenue, and addressed NaN/Null values in ratings.

2. **Data Transformation**:  
   - Introduced "Occupancy Percentage" based on bookings and capacity, leading to deeper insights.

3. **Insights and Analysis**:

   - **Occupancy Insights**:
     - *Highest Rate*: Presidential rooms.
     - *City-wise*: Delhi leads; Bangalore has the lowest occupancy.
     - *Day-wise*: Weekends (>70%) vs. weekdays (50.9%).
     - *Data Completeness*: August data is incomplete for some cities.

   - **Revenue Analysis**:
     - *Delhi*: High occupancy, but low realized revenue.
     - *Revenue Leader*: Mumbai.
     - *Peak Revenue Month*: July.

   - **Business Insights**:
     - *Bangalore*: Lower bookings compared to Mumbai.
     - *Strategic Insight*: Focus on revenue from cancellations.
     - *AtliQ Seasons*: Low cancellation rates due to pricing and location.

   - **Service Quality**:
     - Consistent ratings across cities, but none exceed 4, indicating room for improvement.

   - **Booking Analysis**:
     - *Payment Method*: 40.9% via "others"; requires strategic market analysis.

This summary highlights the key findings and potential areas for strategic improvement.
